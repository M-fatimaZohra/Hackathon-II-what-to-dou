# Hackathon II Constitution Prompt

## Purpose

This Constitution defines the approach, workflow, and standards for the **Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development** project, "The Evolution of Todo." It serves as the guiding framework for implementing all phases of the hackathon using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**, AI agents, and cloud-native architectures.

This document is immutable once committed unless explicitly updated through a Constitution change process.

## Vision

The goal is to evolve a simple console-based Todo application into a **cloud-native, AI-powered, extensible Todo system**. The system should be understandable, scalable, and future-ready, with a clear evolution path across phases.

The project emphasizes:

- Spec-driven iterative development
- AI-native coding via Claude Code
- Cloud-native design principles
- Event-driven and agent-based architecture
- Reusable Intelligence for long-term extensibility

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**
   - All features must originate from written specifications.
   - Specifications are the single source of truth.
   - Code is generated by AI; humans refine intent through specs.

2. **AI-Agent-First Approach**
   - Claude Code is the primary implementation agent.
   - Subagents and agent skills are preferred over monolithic logic.
   - Traceability between specs and generated code must be preserved.

3. **Iterative & Phased Evolution**
   - A single Todo application evolves through multiple phases:
     1. CLI-based Todo App (in-memory)
     2. Full-stack Web Todo App
     3. AI-powered Chatbot Interface
     4. Local Kubernetes Deployment
     5. Cloud-native Event-driven System

4. **Clarity Over Cleverness**
   - Architecture must be explainable.
   - Specs must be readable by humans first, AI second.
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity in early phases.

5. **Future-Ready by Design**
   - Even early phases should allow clean extension.
   - Bonus and advanced features are planned, not hacked in.

---

## Responsibilities

- Write clear, testable specifications before implementation.
- Use Claude Code to generate all core logic.
- Validate behavior via acceptance criteria.
- Update documentation alongside feature evolution.
- Maintain clean separation between phases, features, and concerns.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Spec-Driven Development**: Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code
- **Python Environment**: `uv` (mandatory for Python dependency and environment management)
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (later phases)
- **AI Agents**: OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Dapr
- **Event System**: Kafka / PubSub
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (future phase)

---

## Workflow

1. Write or update feature specifications inside `/specs/[any]_features/`
   - Each folder represents a logical grouping such as:
     - `phase1_features`
     - `auth_features`
     - `ai_features`
     - `infra_features`
2. Each spec must describe **one clear behavior**.
3. Specs must include:
   - Purpose
   - User stories
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Example inputs/outputs
4. Ask Claude Code to implement strictly according to specs.
5. If behavior is incorrect, **update the spec, not the code**.
6. Repeat iteratively as the system evolves.

---

## Agent & Skill Guidance (`CLAUDE.md`)

- `CLAUDE.md` files serve as **lightweight operational guidance** for Claude Code.
- They explain:
  - What agents or skills exist (if any)
  - When each agent or skill should be used
  - What responsibilities they own
- `CLAUDE.md` files must exist at:
  - Repository root
  - Any folder containing agent logic or reusable intelligence
- These files **do not replace specifications** and must not contain business logic.

### If No Agents or Skills Exist Yet

- `CLAUDE.md` must include **important reminders**, such as:
  - Follow specs strictly
  - Do not invent features
  - Do not modify Constitution
  - Prefer simple implementations
  - Ask for clarification via spec refinement instead of guessing

---

## Documentation Rules

- A top-level `/documentation/` folder must exist.
- This folder contains **nerd-level usage guidance**, including:
  - How the app works internally
  - How to run it in each phase
  - How AI agents interact with the system
  - How to extend or customize features
- Documentation must be updated **whenever a feature is added or changed**.

---

## README Requirements

- The root `README.md` must be updated **before pushing code**.
- README must clearly explain:
  - Current phase
  - How to run the app
  - What features exist
  - What is planned next
- README should stay beginner-friendly; deep details belong in `/documentation/`.

---

## Bonus & Future Features (Planned, Not Required Initially)

These features are considered **future extensions** and should be implemented only after core phases are stable:

1. **Reusable Intelligence**
   - Create and reuse Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills.
   - Agents should be composable and phase-independent.

2. **Cloud-Native Blueprints**
   - Infrastructure and deployment patterns implemented via Agent Skills.
   - Blueprints should be reusable across projects.

3. **Multi-language Support**
   - Chatbot should support **Urdu** as an additional language.

4. **Voice Commands**
   - Enable voice input for Todo commands in later phases.

Each bonus feature must have its **own dedicated spec folder** before implementation.

---

## Core Philosophy

- One app, many evolutions.
- Specs define intent; AI writes code.
- Humans stay in the architect role.
- The system should feel *inevitable*, not improvised.

---

## Change Governance

- The Constitution cannot be changed casually.
- Any update requires:
  - Clear justification
  - Explicit documentation
  - Conscious recommitment to SDD principles

## Response snapshot

The Hackathon II Constitution has been successfully created at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. The constitution defines the approach, workflow, and standards for the Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development project, "The Evolution of Todo." It includes:

- Core principles for Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
- AI-Agent-First Approach guidelines
- Iterative & Phased Evolution strategy
- Clarity Over Cleverness philosophy
- Future-Ready by Design principles
- Technology stack requirements
- Development workflow guidelines
- Governance procedures

The constitution is version 1.0.0 and has been ratified on 2025-12-24.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational governance document for Hackathon II project
- 🧪 Tests: none required
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create feature specifications for Todo app phases
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guidance for implementing all phases of the hackathon using Spec-Driven Development, AI agents, and cloud-native architectures

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing CLI-based Todo App (Phase 1) according to specifications

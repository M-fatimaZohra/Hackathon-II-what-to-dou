## Prompt Text

```
/sp.specify

Phase II – Full‑Stack Todo Web Application with authentication, persistent storage, and modern UI
```

## Response Text

Successfully created the specification for the Phase II Full-Stack Todo Web Application using the proper /sp.specify workflow. The specification includes:

1. Created feature branch 002-todo-web-app
2. Generated comprehensive specification document at specs/002-todo-web-app/spec.md
3. Created quality checklist at specs/002-todo-web-app/checklists/requirements.md

The specification includes:
- User scenarios with priorities (P1-P3) and acceptance criteria
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-013)
- Key entities (User and Task)
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-006)
- Edge cases for security and error handling

The specification follows the SDD approach, focusing on user value and business needs without implementation details, and is ready for the next phase of planning.

## Evaluation

# AI Chatbot Features of What to Dou App

## Overview

The What to Dou application now includes an intelligent AI Chatbot that allows you to manage your tasks through natural conversation. Instead of clicking buttons and filling forms, you can simply tell the chatbot what you need and it will handle the rest.

## Chatbot Features

- **Complete Tasks by Name:** Say "Mark the grocery shopping task as done"

# Hackathon II: The Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
All features must originate from written specifications. Specifications are the single source of truth. Code is generated by AI; humans refine intent through specs.

### II. AI-Agent-First Approach
Claude Code is the primary implementation agent. Subagents and agent skills are preferred over monolithic logic. Traceability between specs and generated code must be preserved.

### III. Iterative & Phased Evolution
A single Todo application evolves through multiple phases: 1) CLI-based Todo App (in-memory), 2) Full-stack Web Todo App, 3) AI-powered Chatbot Interface, 4) Local Kubernetes Deployment, 5) Cloud-native Event-driven System.

### IV. Clarity Over Cleverness
Architecture must be explainable. Specs must be readable by humans first, AI second. Avoid unnecessary complexity in early phases.

### V. Future-Ready by Design
Even early phases should allow clean extension. Bonus and advanced features are planned, not hacked in.

### VI. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced.

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack requirements include: Python FastAPI for backend, Next.js with Tailwind CSS for frontend, PostgreSQL for database (later phases), Docker and Kubernetes for deployment, Kafka/PubSub for event system, Better Auth for authentication (future phase).

## Development Workflow
1. Write or update feature specifications inside `/specs/[any]_features/`
2. Each spec must describe one clear behavior
3. Specs must include: Purpose, User stories, Acceptance criteria, Example inputs/outputs
4. Ask Claude Code to implement strictly according to specs
5. If behavior is incorrect, update the spec, not the code
6. Repeat iteratively as the system evolves

## Governance
The Constitution defines the approach, workflow, and standards for the Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development project. It serves as the guiding framework for implementing all phases of the hackathon using Spec-Driven Development (SDD), AI agents, and cloud-native architectures. The Constitution is immutable once committed unless explicitly updated through a Constitution change process. Amendments require clear justification, explicit documentation, and conscious recommitment to SDD principles.
